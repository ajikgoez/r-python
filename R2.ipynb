The Appendix is closed by a section on writing true R programs (batch mode). \n",

Alternatively, the whole R code can be prepared in advance as a plain text file and run at once in batch mode. The commands (functions) in R are entered either individually, each on a single line, or are separated by a semicolon(`;`).

Each command is followed by brackets with parameters (or empty, if none are required or default values are desired). Typing just the command name returns a listing of the function’s definition.\n",
